        CSS is used to control the style of a web document in a simple and easy way.
It helps to define the presentation of HTML elements as a separate file known as CSS file having .css extension.
CSS helps to change formatting of any HTML element by just making changes at one place.
CSS Rules
CSS Rules are the styles that we have to create in order to create style sheets. These rules define appearance of associated HTML element.
